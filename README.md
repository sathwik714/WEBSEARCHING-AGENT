Search and Summarize: AI-Powered Web Research Tool

Overview

This Jupyter notebook implements an intelligent web research assistant that combines web search capabilities with AI-powered summarization. It automates the process of gathering information from the internet and distilling it into concise, relevant summaries, enhancing the efficiency of online research tasks.

Motivation

In the age of information overload, efficiently extracting relevant knowledge from the vast expanse of the internet is increasingly challenging. This tool addresses several key pain points:

1.Time consumption in manual web searches

2.Information overload from multiple sources

3.Difficulty in quickly grasping key points from lengthy articles

4.Need for focused research on specific websites

By automating the search and summarization process, this tool aims to significantly reduce the time and cognitive load associated with web research, allowing users to quickly gain insights on any topic.

Key Components
The notebook consists of several integral components:

Web Search Module: Utilizes DuckDuckGo's search API to fetch relevant web pages based on user queries.

Result Parser: Processes raw search results into a structured format for further analysis.

Text Summarization Engine: Leverages OpenAI's language models to generate concise summaries of web content.

Integration Layer: Combines the search and summarization functionalities into a seamless workflow.

Method Details

Web Search Process

The user provides a search query and optionally specifies a target website.

If a specific site is given, the tool performs two searches: a. A site-specific search within the specified domain b. A general search excluding the specified site
Without a specific site, it conducts a general web search.

Search results are parsed to extract snippets, titles, and links.

Summarization Approach

For each search result, the tool extracts the relevant text content.

The extracted text is sent to the AI model with a prompt requesting a concise summary.

The AI generates a summary in the form of 1-2 bullet points, capturing the key information.

Summaries are compiled along with their sources (title and link).

Integration and Output

The tool combines the web search and summarization processes into a single function call.

It returns a formatted output containing summaries from multiple sources, each clearly attributed.

The output is designed to provide a quick overview of the topic, with links to full sources for further reading.
